# ImageFilter
The Image Filter application allows users to upload an image and apply various filters to modify its appearance. Users can select an image file from their device and see it displayed on the webpage. If any filters are applied, users can click the "Undo" button to revert the image back to its original state. Basic filters such as "Make Red," "Make Green," and "Make Blue" allow users to change the color characteristics of the image. Intermediate filters like "Make Blur," "Make Grey," and "Make Rainbow" offer more advanced modifications. Custom filters such as "Behind bars," "Black Pixel," and "White Pixel" provide specialized transformations. The canvas on the webpage displays the modified image, and users can experiment with different filters to observe the visual transformations applied to their uploaded images.
